# ðŸ§  Deep Learning with Tensorflow

All of my resource for my work.Some of it based o Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.
You could check almost every notebook. It is mostly tested in Google Colab so it means that you could try to replicate from my work for further research.

## ðŸ“‚ Materials
I will try to update all the resource in the future. It will included:
- Object Detection
- Natural Language Processor
- Time Series Analysis
- Helper Function

## ðŸ“• Other Good Resources
I will pasted all the good resource here
