# ðŸ§  Deep Learning with Tensorflow

All of my tools for working with TensorFlow. The Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course is the base for some of it. Since it was largely tested in Google Colab, you might try to duplicate my findings for further in-depth analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Materials
I will try to update all the resources in the future. Such as:
- [Computer Vision](https://github.com/northpr/tensorflow-resources/tree/main/computer_vision)
- [Natural Language Processor](https://github.com/northpr/tensorflow-resources/tree/main/natural_language_processing)
- [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/northpr/tensorflow-resources/tree/main/time_series)
- Helper Function

## ðŸ“• Other Good Resources
I will paste all the good resources here

| Number | Type | Website | Detail |
| ---- | ---- |---- | ---- |
| 00 | Certificate | [github/mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) | Very good resources that help me pass the tensorflow exam. |
| 01 | Computer Vision | [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/) | If you don't understand Convolutional Neural Network, try this website |
| 02 | NLP | [Word2Vec](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/) | Very in detailed of Word2Vec |
